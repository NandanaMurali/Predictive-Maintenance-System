# Predictive-Maintenance-System
Objective: Build a system to predict machinery failures based on sensor data and usage patterns.
â€¢ Modules:
1. Data Parsing and Transformation: Use Streams and File I/O to process incoming telemetry files.
2. Algorithms: Implement searching/sorting algorithms to analyze sensor logs.
3. Message Handler: Use the Message Handler design pattern to process and prioritize maintenance alerts.
4. Lambda Expressions: Simplify custom operations on datasets (e.g., filtering and mapping).
5. State Pattern: Model different states of machinery (Running, Maintenance, Shutdown)
